  Introduction
</h2>
This Housing agent application allows users to load and save multiple houses and properties created by the user to the system. A user can add various houses/properties, delete houses, update houses and list all houses/ properties on the system along with being able to save all these houses to the system to be successfully loaded back up again when the program ends.
Once the program starts the user is introduced to a skelton menu as shown below and can choose any of the 10 options listed to start using the Housing Agent App ! When option 2 is selected <em> List All Houses </em> a Sub-Menu appears with 3 more options: 

- List All Houses()
- List All Sold Houses()
- List All unSold Houses()
